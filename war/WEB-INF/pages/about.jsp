<h1>About LampCMS</h1>
<P>LampCMS is an full-featured <strong>Open Source</strong>
Question and Answers web program written in PHP with deep
integration with Facebook, Twitter, Google, Linked-IN, Tumblr and Blogger APIs</P>
<P>It uses <strong>MongoDB</strong> as a database to achieve speed and scalability.
</P>
<P>Question/Answer websites are becoming
very popular, many people find them to be a better choice for
building online communities than a traditional web forum.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Just like many other Question and
Answer sites, LampCMS is tag-based, but it also has support for categories and unlimited sub-categories.</P>
<P>Some people have been referring to LampCMS as
 an <em>Open Source StackOverflow and Quora crossover</em>. All we can say is there are certainly
 several features similar to those of <em>StackOverflow</em> and several similar to <em>Quora</em> but this program also
 has some features similar traditionally found in popular Forum Software like "Sticky threads" and "Dot folders"
